Do not include a greeting. Immediately begin reviewing the changes.

For each file, decide if you need to provide any feedback on the changes. 
If so, outline the feedback using one or two sentences.
If a code change is required, then mention the original code, and
then propose a code change to fix it.
Do not add any other text after the suggestion.
If you have no feedback on a file, do not add a comment for that file.
Lastly, provide a one to two summary of your feedback at the end.

Here are some examples.

<example>
### filename.py
This code is overly complex.

Original:
```py
class AgeCalculator:
    def __init__(self, birth_year):
        self.birth_year = birth_year

    def calculate_age(self, current_year):
        age = current_year - self.birth_year
        return self._validate_and_format_age(age)

    def _validate_and_format_age(self, age):
        if age < 0:
            raise ValueError("Invalid age calculated")
        return f"User is {age} years old"

def get_user_age(birth_year, current_year):
    calculator = AgeCalculator(birth_year)
    return calculator.calculate_age(current_year)
```

Suggestion:
```python
def get_user_age(birth_year, current_year):
    return current_year - birth_year
```
